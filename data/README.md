# Weather
External weather data is used to predict the temperature and humidity levels over the next minutes/months. Data is collected from an external API and formatted in a csv file so that it can be easily streamed.

# Occupancy
Using IoT sensors and ML algorithms it is possible to estimate the occupancy in the room. This is useful for predicting the temperature and humidity levels in the room.

# Energetic quotas
Using information from several sources depending on location, it indicates the consumption load of the grid during a specific time of day. This is useful for taking into consideration the energetic load of the grid when adjusting the temperature in the room.
